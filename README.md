  <summary style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Long story (click to view)</strong></summary>

In Iowa, intensive agricultural activities have contributed to water pollution in many recreational water bodies. Besides local water quality concerns, pollutant loading from Iowa also impacted downstream communities (i.e., the Gulf of Mexico). As an environmental research engineer and a community member who enjoys water recreational activities, I am passionate about improving water quality through best management practices. <br> 

I am interested in environmental monitoring to investigate the fate and transport of point source (e.g., urban) and nonpoint source (e.g., agriculture) pollutants in the environment. Besides identifying the pollutant sources, I also provide strategies to manage or remediate land and water resources using the most cost-effective approaches. <br>

I enjoy a good mix of lab, field, and office tasks. In the lab, I design and conduct lab-scale studies that typically serve as a proof-of-concept. In the field, I test and demonstrate the scalability and practicability of successful lab experiments. I also help nonprofit, state, and private agencies design and conduct watershed-scale water quality monitoring. I also help clients identify practical best management practices to meet their soil and water quality goals. Finally, in the office, I typically spend my time writing proposals, budgeting, preparing work plans/SOPs, analyzing data, and writing technical reports and peer-reviewed articles. <br> 

Besides environmental monitoring/treatment in agroecosystems, I am also interested in urban water resources management and treatment. I was exposed to municipal wastewater treatment during my internship after completing my B.S. degree. During my M.S. program, I included Civil (Environmental focus) Engineering as my co-major and have taken several urban stormwater and wastewater treatment courses. While I primarily work on agroecosystems projects, I keep myself updated with urban waste/wastewater management and treatment technologies. <br>

Retiring as a fish farmer is my long-term goal, and I wish to apply my water quality expertise in sustainable aquaculture. Specifically, I aim to improve aquaculture production and cost efficiency using recirculating aquaculture or aquaponics systems.
