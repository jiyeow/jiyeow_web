- I grew up in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. <br>
- I moved out from Malaysia to Ames, Iowa, United States. <br>
- I was shocked to find out that Ames is not like Los Angeles (thank you Hollywood). <br>
- I got my B.S. and M.S. degrees at Iowa State University. <br>
- I had a few hourly jobs and internships when studying. <br>
- I am now a full-time research engineer at Iowa State University. <br>
- I collect environmental samples and chase after waterfowls when I am working outside. <br>
- I stare at computer screen and drink too much coffee when I am working inside. <br>
- I enjoy building stuff (woodworking) and fixing stuff (my car) in my garage. <br>
- I obsess with camping, hiking, biking, skiing, fishing, canoeing, and snorkelling. <br>
- I got stuck in Ames (just kidding - I fell in love with Ames). <br>
- I look forward to next adventures and challenges in a new city. <br>

## Education
#### Short story
- __Master of Science (2017), Iowa State University__ <br>
Co-majors: Agricultural & Biosystems Engineering (Land & Water Resources Focus) <br>
Civil Engineering (Environmental Focus) <br>
Thesis Title: Electrical stimulation for enhanced denitrification in woodchip bioreactors. <br>
GPA: 3.92/4.00 <br>
- __Bachelor of Science, _magna cum laude_, Iowa State University__ (2016) <br>
Major: Agricultural Engineering (Land & Water Resources Focus) <br>
GPA: 3.76/4.00 <br>

#### Long story
I received both my M.S. and B.S. degrees from Iowa State University (ISU). I began my undergraduate journey in Agricultural Engineering in 2013, focusing on Land & Water Resources Options. While I worked as an undergraduate research assistant (URA), I was fortunate to gain many hands-on experiences in various research projects. As I expressed my interest in pursuing my own research project, my supervisor (Dr. Michelle Soupir) encouraged and supported me to enroll in the concurrent program. This program allowed me to begin my first year of the M.S. program while completing the senior year of my B.S. degree in September 2015. Later, I graduated with a __B.S. degree in Agricultural Engineering _(magna cum laude)_ with an Agribusiness minor__ in May 2016. In July 2017, I received my __M.S. degree co-majoring in Agricultural & Biosystems Engineering and Civil Engineering__.
