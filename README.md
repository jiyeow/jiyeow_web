  I received both my M.S. and B.S. degrees from Iowa State University (ISU). I began my undergraduate journey in Agricultural Engineering in 2013, focusing on Land & Water Resources Options. While I worked as an undergraduate research assistant (URA), I was fortunate to gain many hands-on experiences in various research projects. As I expressed my interest in pursuing my own research project, my supervisor (Dr. Michelle Soupir) encouraged and supported me to enroll in the concurrent program. This program allowed me to begin my first year of the M.S. program while completing the senior year of my B.S. degree in September 2015. Later, I graduated with a __B.S. degree in Agricultural Engineering _(magna cum laude)_ with an Agribusiness minor__ in May 2016. In July 2017, I received my __M.S. degree co-majoring in Agricultural & Biosystems Engineering and Civil Engineering__.

## Area of Interest and Expertise
- Fate and transport of point source and nonpoint source pollutants in the environment
- Soil and water management and remediation (i.e., best management practices)
- Data management, statistical analysis, techno-economic analysis
- Water resources management
- Wastewater treatments
- Aquaculture and aquaponics

In Iowa, the primary water quality issues (e.g., nutrients, sediment, bacteria impairments) were contributed by intensive agricultural activities. Besides local water quality concerns, pollutant loading from Iowa also has impacted downstream communities environmentally and economically (i.e., the Gulf of Mexico). As an environmental research engineer, as well as a community member who enjoys water recreational activities, I am passionate about improving water quality through best management practices. <br> 

I am interested in environmental monitoring, which studies the fate and transport of point source (e.g., urban) and nonpoint source (e.g., agriculture) pollutants in the environment. Besides identifying the pollutant sources, I also provide strategies to manage or remediate land and water resources using the most cost-effective approaches. <br>

I enjoy a good mix of tasks in the lab, field, and office. In the lab, I design and conduct lab-scale studies that typically serve as proof-of-concept. In the field, I test and demonstrate the scalability and practicability of successful lab experiments. I also help nonprofit, state, and private agencies design and perform field monitoring. When needed, I also help clients to identify suitable best management practices that meet his/her/their soil and water quality goals, landscape characteristics, treatment time, and costs. Finally, in the office, I typically spend my time writing proposals, budgeting, prepare work plans/SOPs, data analysis (e.g., statistics), and writing technical reports and peer-reviewed articles. <br> 

Besides environmental monitoring/treatment in the agroecosystems, I also enjoy working on urban water resources management and treatment. I was first exposed to municipal wastewater treatment during my internship after completing my B.S. degree. During my M.S. program, I declared a co-major in Civil (Environmental focus) Engineering and have taken several urban stormwater and wastewater treatment courses. While I primarily work on agroecosystems projects, I occasionally keep myself updated with urban waste/wastewater management and treatment technologies. <br>

Retiring as a fish farmer is my long-term goal, and I wish to apply my water quality expertise in sustainable aquaculture. Specifically, I aim to improve the production and cost efficiency of aquaculture using recirculating aquaculture and/or aquaponics systems.
